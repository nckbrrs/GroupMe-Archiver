# GroupMeArchiver
These programs can be used to pull the entire contents of a GroupMe group's transcript as a JSON file, and convert that JSON into one or more HTML files that can be easily viewed in any browser. I realize there is a good chance that this has been done before; I am mainly doing it for fun and to practice my craft outside of the classroom.
